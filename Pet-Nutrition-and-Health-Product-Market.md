According to market reports, the global pet food industry alone was valued at over $90 billion in 2020 and continues to grow.

This included the rise of holistic and organic pet foods, supplements, and treats that promoted well-being, mobility, and immunity.</li> <li><strong>Pet humanization trend:</strong> As pets increasingly became integral members of the family, pet owners started to treat their pets with more individualized care, demanding products that matched human food standards in terms of quality and ethics.</li> <li><strong>Growth in pet supplements:</strong> Supplementation for joint health, digestion, and skin & coat care experienced significant growth, driven by an aging pet population and the focus on preventative health.</li></ul><h2>Pet Nutrition and Health Product Demand Outlook (2023-2033)</h2><p>The outlook for pet nutrition and health products from 2023 to 2033 is even more optimistic, with the market expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.5% over the next decade. This growth is attributed to several key factors:</p><ul> <li><strong>Personalized pet health:</strong> Advances in technology and veterinary care are enabling more personalized diets and supplements tailored to a pet’s specific health needs, including genetic testing and data-driven insights.</li> <li><strong>Sustainability in pet food:</strong> Eco-conscious consumers are demanding more sustainable products, from plant-based foods to ethically sourced meat and sustainable packaging.
