Educating consumers about the risks of poor oral health remains a challenge.</li> <li><strong>Price Sensitivity:</strong> Although premium products are gaining popularity, price sensitivity among pet owners in certain regions could limit the accessibility of high-end dental care products.</li> <li><strong>Regulatory Hurdles:</strong> The pet oral care market is subject to regulations, especially regarding product safety and efficacy. Companies must ensure their products meet safety standards to build trust with consumers.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, the pet oral hygiene market from 2023 to 2033 is expected to be marked by technological advancements, greater consumer awareness, and geographic expansion.
